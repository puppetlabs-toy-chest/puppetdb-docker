This project hosts the Dockerfile and the required scripts to build a PuppetDB container image.

For compose file see: [CRAFTY](https://github.com/voxpupuli/crafty/tree/main/puppet/oss)

The PuppetDB container requires a working postgres container or other suitably
configured PostgreSQL database. For a Compose example see the [CRAFTY OSS Demo compose.yaml](https://github.com/voxpupuli/crafty/blob/main/puppet/oss/compose.yaml)

You can change configuration settings by mounting volumes containing
configuration files or by using this image as a base image. For the defaults,
see the [Dockerfile and supporting folders](https://github.com/voxpupuli/container-puppetdb/tree/main/puppetdb).

For more details about PuppetDB, see the [official documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/index.html).

## New version schema

The new version schema has the following layout:

```text
<puppet.major>.<puppet.minor>.<puppet.patch>-v<container.major>.<container.minor>.<container.patch>
```

Example usage:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetdb:7.13.0-v1.2.1
```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| puppet.major | Describes the contained major Puppet version (7 or 8) |
| puppet.minor | Describes the contained minor Puppet version |
| puppet.patch | Describes the contained patchlevel Puppet version |
| container.major | Describes the major version of the base container (Ubunutu 22.04) or incompatible changes |
| container.minor | Describes new features or refactoring with backward compatibility |
| container.patch | Describes if minor changes or bugfixes have been implemented |

### Cert File Locations

The directory structure follows the following conventions.  The full path is always available inside the container as the environment variable `$SSLDIR`

- 'ssl-ca-cert'
  `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/certs/certs/ca.pem`

- 'ssl-cert'
  `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/certs/certs/<certname>.pem`

- 'ssl-key'
  `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/certs/private_keys/<certname>.pem`

## Initialization Scripts

If you would like to do additional initialization, add a directory called `/docker-custom-entrypoint.d/` and fill it with `.sh` scripts.
These scripts will be executed at the end of the entrypoint script, before the service is ran.
